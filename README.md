### Overview:
A single page front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.

### Specifications:
Built with `Javascript`, `Python`, `Django`, `HTML/CSS`, and `SQLite`.

The website never reloads, meaning it does not request multiple html pages, everything is done via JavaScript to update the DOM.

### Inbox
The populated inbox displays all emails: `read` emails are displayed with a dark gray background and `unread` emails are displayed with a white background and bold text.

Additionally there is a `read/unread` button in the left of the div to switch the boolean values.
